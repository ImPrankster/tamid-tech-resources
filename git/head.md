# Git - Master

This guide is intended as a primer for understanding
what `master` is. You should have previously
read [about commits](commit.md).

## Master

So far we've create a few commits. Let create another.

```sh
> echo "goodbye" >> file.txt

# Add the new contents
> git add .

> git commit -m "Third commit"

[master 41ce7fa] Third commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

So what is this `master` exactly?
You probably already know that it's a branch,
but what is that?

Let's take a detour.

## Graph

Git has a very "rich" (read: confusing as hell) command line.
In general I want to avoid throwing around 10 different versions
of a command, that is probably going to be confusing at this stage.
`log` alone has about 30 options, many of which can be very useful.
The ones I want to show now look like this:

```
> git log --graph --oneline --decorate 41ce7fa

* 41ce7fa (HEAD, master) Third commit
* 672e562 Second commit
* 406bb3b Initial commit
```

> What does each of those options do?
> Can you use different combinations of them[?](explanation/log_options.md)

So this contains one extra bit of Git terminology we haven't seen before. `HEAD`.

## HEAD

Understanding `HEAD` is critical to understanding how Git _really_ works,
so let's take a second to dig a little deeper.

Way back in the beginning we looked at the contents of the `.git` directory.
Let's do that again:

```sh
> ls -F .git

COMMIT_EDITMSG
HEAD
branches/
config
description
hooks/
index
info/
logs/
objects/
refs/
```

Interesting, there's a file called `HEAD`. Let's take a look.

```sh
# The `cat` command prints the contents of a file on the terminal
> cat .git/HEAD

ref: refs/heads/master
```

So we should recognise the `master` part, but what is `refs/heads/`?

Let's keep digging.

## Refs

You'll also notice there is a `refs/` directory in `.git`.

```sh
> ls -F .git/refs

heads/
tags/
```

Ignore `tags`, let's focus on `heads`.

```sh
> ls -F .git/refs/heads

master
```

And at the end of the rabbit hole?

```sh
> cat .git/refs/heads/master

41ce7faa5b8b2cf480d44c3b12f0545fed9683c3
```

That's the most recent commit!
So `HEAD` is just a reference to `refs/heads/master`,
which in turn is just a reference to a specific commit,
which captures a collection of files.

Something like this:

```
HEAD -> refs/heads/master -> 41ce7fa -> file.txt
```

Actually that looks a _little_ like our `log --graph` command.

```
> git log --graph --oneline --decorate 41ce7fa

* 41ce7fa (HEAD, master) Third commit
* 672e562 Second commit
* 406bb3b Initial commit
```

It would appear that `refs/heads/master` is just the long winded way
of saying `master`. They're the _same_ thing.

Perhaps a slightly more obscure point is that a branch is just a "head" ref.
Said another way - everything under `refs/heads` is a branch.
We look at some other types of refs [later on](remotes.md), but for now we
might just focus on heads.

> If you make another commit what changes? Is it `HEAD` or the ref[?](explanation/head_commit.md)

## Next

Ok, that's probably enough for this section.
Next we'll see what happens when we start creating
[multiple branches](branches.md).
