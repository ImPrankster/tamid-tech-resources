# Git - Reflog

You should have previously read [about branches](branches.md).

For the most part Git tries to keep you safe and
make sure that nothing bad happens to your branches/commits.
However, there are cases where you may accidentally "lose"
a commit.

Not to fear! Git has a nifty way to find those missing commits.

## Lost

At one point the graph looked something like this.

```sh
> git log --graph --oneline --decorate master

* 41ce7fa (HEAD, master) Third commit
* 672e562 (hello) Second commit
* 406bb3b Initial commit
```

The `HEAD` is referencing `master`, which is at a different commit
to `hello`.

Let's checkout `hello`.

```sh
> git checkout hello

> git log --graph --oneline --decorate master

* 41ce7fa (master) Third commit
* 672e562 (HEAD, hello) Second commit
* 406bb3b Initial commit
```

And now for something a little crazy.

```sh
# Delete the master branch - weeeeeeee
> rm .git/refs/heads/master

> git log --graph --oneline --decorate hello

* 672e562 (HEAD, hello) Second commit
* 406bb3b Initial commit
```

Oh no, where did it go?
How do we get it back?!?

### Warning

In many cases Git will actually try to prevent this ever happening.
There are checks and warnings on the relevant Git commands that will
stop you shooting yourself in the foot.

This goes without saying but it is _always_ recommended to use Git
commands rather than modifying the contents of the `.git` directory.

## Found

It's hard to imagine that just by deleting the ref file that we
_actually_ deleted the commit itself. The commit message
has to be stored separately at least.

Does the commit still exist? Let's check by using the commit hash...

```sh
> git log --graph --oneline --decorate 41ce7fa

* 41ce7fa Third commit
* 672e562 (HEAD, hello) Second commit
* 406bb3b Initial commit
```

Phew! So it's still there. But what happens if we didn't know,
or forgot the hash?

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the...

## Reflog

```sh
> git reflog HEAD

672e562 HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from master to hello
41ce7fa HEAD@{1}: commit: Third commit
672e562 HEAD@{2}: commit: Second commit
406bb3b HEAD@{3}: commit (initial): Initial commit
```

Whenever you run `commit` or `checkout` commands, Git logs the
the old and new commits.
So for _every_ change to your `HEAD` (and refs) Git actually tracks
what happened. The <i>ref</i>log.

A (very bad) anology is a bank keeping a transaction log of changes
to your account. Or at least you hope they do!

My advice - don't leave home without `git reflog`.

If you're interested in how that is actually stored in `.git`:

```sh
> cat .git/logs/HEAD
