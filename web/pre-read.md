# ["A Short History of Web" - CERN](https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web)

Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web in March 1989 and his second proposal in May 1990. Together with Belgian systems engineer Robert Cailliau, this was formalized as a management proposal in November 1990. This outlined the principal concepts, and it defined important terms behind the Web. The document described a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" could be viewed by “browsers”.
By the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had the first Web server and browser up and running at CERN, demonstrating his ideas. He developed the code for his Web server on a NeXT computer. To prevent it being accidentally switched off, the computer had a hand-written label in red ink: "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"

## The History of Web Development

In the mid-1990s, the introduction of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allowed developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and update the appearance of web pages. JavaScript was also introduced around the same time, allowing developers to create interactive and dynamic web pages.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, web development saw a boom in popularity with the introduction of web-based applications and e-commerce sites. This led to the development of more advanced web technologies and frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails and jQuery, which made web development faster and more efficient.

In the late 2000s and early 2010s, web development focused on creating responsive and mobile-friendly web designs. This was facilitated by the introduction of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS and ReactJS.

Today, web development continues to evolve with the increasing popularity of web-based applications, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the growing importance of website accessibility and user experience. The future of web development is likely to see the continued development of new technologies and frameworks to create more advanced, intuitive, and user-friendly web applications.

### Readings to prepare yourself for the Workshop

[Getting started with the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

MDN is a community-driven open source project, supported by Mozilla. It is a place to learn the web and to build the web.

The way I recommend going through the MDN tutorial:

- Start with Understanding [How the Web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)
- Read [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)
- Then learn [HTML basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)
- Then, [CSS basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)
- Finally, [JavaScript basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)
